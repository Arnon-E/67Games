## Key Architecture Rules

1. **All game logic lives in `game_state.dart`** — screens only call methods and watch state.
2. **Screen routing is state-driven** — `AppScreen` enum in `game_state.dart`, rendered in `app.dart`.
3. **New strings need updating in 6 places**: `app_en.arb`, `app_he.arb`, `app_ru.arb` + the three `app_localizations_*.dart` generated files (and the abstract `app_localizations.dart`).
4. **New cosmetics**: add to `constants.dart` (kWrestlerSkins/kShopItems), add default to `_ownedCosmetics` in `game_state.dart`, add equipCosmetic/unequipCosmetic case.
5. **New game modes**: add to `kGameModes` in `constants.dart`, handle in `game_state.dart`'s `stopGame()`, add l10n strings.
6. **Multiplayer matches**: Never write directly to Firestore outside of `matchmaking_service.dart`. All match state flows through `_subscribeToMatch()` listener.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — production
- `claude/<feature-name>` — feature branches for Claude's work
- Current active branch: `claude/add-1v1-sharing-ads-itHJR`

Always push to the assigned Claude branch. Do NOT push to `main`.

## Active Features (Recently Built)

### Fight Mode (commit `8719f46` on `claude/add-wrestling-combat-2aVCN`)

A wrestling-themed combat mode layered on top of 1v1 multiplayer:

**Entry:** Menu "1v1 MATCH" → bottom sheet → "Fight Mode" → "vs Bot" or "vs Player"

**Mechanics:**
- Each player starts with **3 HP**
- Win a round → deal damage: **1 HP** (normal), **2 HP** (perfect 0ms stop), **+1 HP if speed ≥ 2.0×**
- Speed auto-increases +0.2× each round
- First to 0 HP → KNOCKOUT

**Key state in `game_state.dart`:**
```dart
static const int kFightMaxHp = 3;
bool _fightModeActive
int _myFightHp, _opponentFightHp
int _fightRound
int _lastRoundMyDamage, _lastRoundOpponentDamage
bool get isFightOver  // true when any HP ≤ 0
```

**Key methods:**
- `startFightVsBot()` — reset HP, start bot match
- `startFightMatchmaking()` — reset HP, find real opponent
- `fightNextRound()` — auto-rematch with speed increase
- `_processFightRound(myScore, oppScore, myDeviationMs, oppDeviationMs)` — calc damage

**Wrestler Skins (`wrestler_avatar.dart`, `kWrestlerSkins` in `constants.dart`):**

| ID | Name | Price | Accessory |
|----|------|-------|-----------|
| `wrestler_default` | Classic | Free | Headband |
| `wrestler_ninja` | Ninja | 500 coins | Face mask |
| `wrestler_robot` | Robot | 800 coins | Visor |
| `wrestler_fire` | Inferno | 600 coins | Flames |
| `wrestler_ice` | Glacier | 600 coins | Crown |
| `wrestler_gold` | Champion | 1,200 coins | Belt |

Skins are drawn with `CustomPainter` (no image assets needed). To replace with AI-generated art: place 200×220px PNG at `assets/wrestlers/<id>.png` and switch `WrestlerAvatar` to `Image.asset`.

**WrestlerAvatar params (new):**
- `punchProgress` (0.0–1.0) — animates right arm into a punch
- `isKnocked` (bool) — X eyes + open dazed mouth

**KO screen animation (`_KOFightScene` widget, `match_results_screen.dart`):**
- Mortal Kombat-style: winner steps in → punch extends → white impact flash → loser knocked back with X eyes + stars
- 2.2s `AnimationController`, plays once on entry then holds final frame

## Scoring Quick Reference

```
rawScore = 1000 × exp(−0.00326 × deviationMs)
finalScore = rawScore × streakMultiplier × perfectBonus × modeMultiplier

Deviation tiers: Perfect(0ms) | Incredible(≤10ms) | Excellent(≤50ms) |
                 Great(≤100ms) | Good(≤250ms) | OK(≤500ms) | Miss(>500ms)

Streak: maintained if deviation ≤50ms, broken if >50ms, frozen between
Streak multiplier: 1.0 + (streak × 0.1), capped at 2.0×
Perfect bonus: 3× if deviationMs == 0
XP: finalScore ÷ 10
```

---

## Multiplayer Architecture

```
Firestore Collections:
  matchmaking_queue/{uid}  ← players waiting for opponent
  matches/{matchId}        ← live match documents

Match lifecycle: waiting → countdown → playing → finished/cancelled

Bot fallback: if no opponent in 7s → bot option appears
              bot results generated locally (20-150ms random deviation)

Heartbeat: each client writes a timestamp every 10s via sendHeartbeat()
           _opponentGone() returns true if opponent heartbeat > 30s stale
           handles disconnect detection without Firestore presence feature

Speed negotiation: lobby shows "Speed Challenge" dialog if one player
                   wants to speed up; both must accept for speed to apply

Fight mode: HP tracked in GameState (client-side), both clients
            calculate identically from same Firestore match results

Fight invite (friend challenge):
  fight_invites/{code}  ← 6-char code, status: waiting → accepted, TTL 10min
  Host creates → shares code → guest joins → both queue with preferOpponentUid
  FightInviteScreen (AppScreen.fightInvite) shows code + share sheet (share_plus)
  joinFightByCode(code) in game_state.dart — guest-side join flow
  createFightInvite() / cancelFightInvite() — host-side flow

Deep link invite (direct open):
  Share text includes stopat67://fight?code=ABC123 — tapping opens the app directly
  Android: intent-filter for stopat67://fight in AndroidManifest.xml
  iOS: CFBundleURLSchemes includes "stopat67" in Info.plist
  app_links package handles cold-start (getInitialLink) + warm-start (uriLinkStream)
  Both route through handleIncomingFightInviteUri() → joinFightByCode()
  _extractFightInviteCodeFromUri() parses query param, path segment, or fragment
  If unauthenticated: code saved to _pendingFightInviteCode, resumed after sign-in
```

## Adding New Features — Patterns

### New Game Mode
1. Add `GameMode(...)` to `kGameModes` in `constants.dart`
2. Handle mode-specific state in `game_state.dart` (new fields if needed)
3. Add case to `stopGame()` for result processing
4. Add l10n strings (`mode<Name>Name`, `mode<Name>Desc`)
5. Optionally: add unlock achievement or cosmetic

### New Cosmetic
1. Add skin/item definition to `constants.dart`
2. Add ID to `_ownedCosmetics` default list in `game_state.dart` if free
3. Add `equipType` case to `equipCosmetic()` and `unequipCosmetic()`
4. Add field to `PlayerLoadout.toJson()` / `fromJson()` / `copyWith()`
5. Add shop item strings to l10n files

### New Localization String
1. Add to `app_en.arb`, `app_he.arb`, `app_ru.arb`
2. Add abstract getter/method to `app_localizations.dart`
3. Add implementation to each `app_localizations_*.dart`
4. Use: `AppLocalizations.of(context).yourNewKey`

### New Screen
1. Create `lib/screens/<name>_screen.dart`
2. Add value to `AppScreen` enum in `game_state.dart`
3. Add case to screen router in `app.dart`
4. Add navigation method in `game_state.dart` (e.g., `setScreen(AppScreen.newScreen)`)
5. Handle back navigation in `_backTarget()` in `app.dart`

## Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] Replace AdMob test IDs with production IDs (`ads_service.dart` lines 13, 17, **and new banner line ~20**)
- [ ] Implement RevenueCat (currently stubbed in `subscription_service.dart`)
- [x] Wrestler skins now shown in Shop with WrestlerAvatar preview — buy/equip/unequip live
- [ ] Fight Mode vs real player: opponent doesn't see fight UI unless they also chose Fight Mode
- [ ] Bot difficulty in Fight Mode could be tuned (currently 20–150ms random deviation)
- [ ] Consider adding Fight Mode to the weekly missions system
- [x] Fight Mode friend invite — 6-char share code + FightInviteScreen + join dialog
- [x] Fight invite deep link — share includes stopat67://fight?code=X, opens app directly
- [x] 1v1 ads — banner on matchmaking screen + interstitial after KO + every 3 real matches
